# Btn

`Btn` is a base button component with a simple structure. It can be used with utility classes to create a variety of custom buttons for your app.

It has a few simple features:

- if props has a `href`, it will render as an `a` link, otherwise it will render as a `button`
- `a` link and `button` elements can be replaced with custom components (e.g. to use `Next/Link`)
- can be styled using utility classes (such as with `tailwind`)
- supports icons (based on `react-icons` props)

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.ExampleButton} />
</Canvas>

## Dual purpose

Use a single component to render link or button elements depending on the given props. The button will log an event to the `actions` tab, while the link will open this repo in a new tab.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.DualPurpose} />
</Canvas>

You can swap both the button and link elements for custom components. This may be required when using a frontend framework (such as Next.js, for example), which uses its own `Link` component to handle routing.

In the example below, the custom link component logs the event to the `actions` tab.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.LinkComponent} />
</Canvas>

## Icons

Icon support has been added as one of the few features of the component.

`Btn` will render any icon that supports the `react-icon` props. You can optionally pass a set of icon props to the `Btn` props (to consistently size all icons, for example). Alternatively, you can pass a completely custom component to `icon` and handle the props independently.

You can use utility classes to change the order of label -> icon.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Icon} />
</Canvas>

## Customising styles

Use the `clx` prop to pass an object of classNames to style different parts of the component. Its designed to be used with utility classes (such as with the Tailwind library), but this is not required.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.ClassNames} />
</Canvas>

Supported properties of the `clx` object are:

```ts
export type ClassNamesList = {
  // the wrapper element, this could be an `a` element or `button` element
  button?: string;
  // additional classNames for the wrapper, only applied when it's not disabled
  enabled?: string;
  // additional classNames for the wrapper, only applied when disabled
  disabled?: string;
  // classNames for the span that wraps around the children
  label?: string;
  // classNames that are passed to the icon component
  icon?: string;
};
```

## Props

`Btn` props extends the standard HTML attributes for both `a` and `button` elements.

```ts
export type ButtonProps = HTMLButtonType &
  HTMLLinkType &
  React.DataHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement | HTMLAnchorElement>;

export interface Props extends ButtonProps, React.AriaAttributes {
  clx?: ClxnObject<ClassNamesList>;
  icon?: React.ComponentType<IconBaseProps>;
  buttonComponent?: React.ComponentType<HTMLButtonType> | "button";
  linkComponent?: React.ComponentType<HTMLLinkType> | "a";
  iconProps?: IconBaseProps;
}
```
