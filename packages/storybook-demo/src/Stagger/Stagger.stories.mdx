# Stagger

`Stagger` is a utility component to help manage sequencing of transitions. It arose out of a need to add an element to the DOM and then apply CSS transitions (and vice versa).

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Example} />
</Canvas>

This example shows an element entering the view in three stages, but exiting in two. Each step has an `in` and an `out` duration.

## How it works

The `Stagger` sequence will being when the `start` prop is set to `true`. This will then iterate through each step definition in the `step` props. Each step can have an `in` delay, an `out` delay, and an `id`.

The children of `Stagger` is passed a render prop with information about the status of the step sequence.

- `started`: is a boolean that is true if the sequence has started and false if it has ended.
- `ready(stepId)`: is a function that accepts either the step index (e.g. 0, 1, 2, etc.), or the `id` given to the step. It will return true if the step is "active"
- `unready(stepId)`: this works in a similar way to `ready` but will return true if the step is inactive.

## Props

```tsx
export type StepObject = {
  id?: string;
  in?: number;
  out?: number;
};

export type StepType = number | StepObject;

export type StepProp = StepType | StepType[] | undefined;

export type StepId = number | string;

export interface Props {
  start?: boolean;
  step?: StepProp;
  children(state: {
    started: boolean;
    ready: (id: StepId) => boolean;
    unready: (id: StepId) => boolean;
  }): JSX.Element;
}
```

## Examples

This is a simpler example of how Stagger could be used to render an element in and out of the DOM, while maintaining a CSS transition (e.g. transition wipe):

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Transition} />
</Canvas>
